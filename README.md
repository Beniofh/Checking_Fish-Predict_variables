# Checking Fish-Predict variables

The purpose of this project is to test the interest of different variables for the Fish-Predict project. 

It is composed of the following directories:
- `docs` -> information on the rasters used for the .csv data table 
- `src` -> contains the source codes

To use the codes in the `src` folder, you need to download the `data` folder and place it at the root of your local folder of this repository: [https://seafile.lirmm.fr/d/feee51417e9049d99261/](https://seafile.lirmm.fr/d/feee51417e9049d99261/)

This `src` folder will not be pushed with git thanks to `.gitignore`.
